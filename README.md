# password-generator

## Description

This project was built to test my skills around everything I learned in our third week of Coding Bootcamp. Some skills showcased in this particular exercise are Math.random, adding Event Listeners, creating for loops, console.log, and combining characters through a variety of functions.

## Usage

Open the index.html file in your default browser or view the links as provided through Github to open up password generator. Your screen should look like this:

Once you've opened the files, click on the "Generate Password" button to start the password generation process. Select a number of characters between 8 and 128.

After selecting your character limit, choose different types of characters from the following categories to add into your randomly generated password: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, or special characters.

Once you've chosen your number and types of characters, a password will be randomly generated for you as shown in the screenshot below.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
